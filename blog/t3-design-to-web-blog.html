          <h4 class="question">What is a response site and why is it important?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            A responsive website is one that adapts to how it is viewed be it a small mobile phone or a large computer display.<br>
            The importance is to accommodate the fact that people interact with things in different but will still want the same information.
          </p>

          <h4 class="question">What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Mobile first design is having the Mobile design be the prime focus when starting.<br>
            The reason for starting with mobile is that it is small with space being a premium so it forces the design to be stripped down to essentials.
            The idea is its easier to add bonus parts than to remove things which might be vital.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="question">What are frameworks?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Frameworks are tools for a web page that help by giving foundations for common elements and designs.<br>
            The pros of this is less time needed on fidly little parts to get a passable design in place.
            the cons are it add its own complexity that needs to be learned and can be restrictive when trying new designs
          </p>

          <h4 class="question">What is a wireframe and why use it?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            A wireframe is a barebones example of a page with the physical layout of items in place.<br>
            It is useful as a guide as it can be quickly created and then used as a reference to aim for. It also helps identify the important aspects of a design.

          <h4 class="question">Difficult aspects of the chosen wireframe</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            The sizing of components in comparison to the height of the screen continues to cause issue.<br>
            The rearanging of components between the two display sizes was left out as it seemed like it would require doubling up the items and hidding one or the other.<br>
            The framework used (getskeleton.com) works off different pixel widths rather than display ratios which does not work nicly with high resolution mobile screens.<br>
            Having a design with components that should fix to the side of the window and stay at a set size were a bit difficult so ignored.
