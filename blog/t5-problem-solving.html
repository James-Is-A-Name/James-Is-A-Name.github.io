          <h4 class="question">What problem solving technique did you use?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Systematic backtracking of the problem. Isolating and testing sections.

          <h4 class="question">How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Confused as to why the simple system was behaving erratically.<br>
            Frustrated as to why the individual parts were all working when tried outside of the systems.
          </p>
          <h4 class="question">What did you learn?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Double check the basics that can be checked quickly. It might be simple but it can still be easily mixed up.

          <h4 class="question">Solved a problem in an elegant way. What was the problem?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Cant think of problem that I solved in a way I would say was very elegant.<br>
            Possible a coding test that involved itterating through numbers figuring out how many fit a certain property solved by calculating the answer from the requirements rather than checking numbers.
          </p>

          <h4 class="question">What problem solving technique did you use?</h4>

          <p class="answer">
            slightly disjointed like the simple solution should be right in front of me but just wasnt quite there.
          </p>

          <h4 class="question">What did you learn?</h4>
          <p class="answer">
            Approaching a problem from a completely different angle can yeild intersting results.

          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>- Confident with this as it is useful for seperating things out into seperate parts.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Trying Something</strong>- Used more as a last resort as I prefer having more knowledge of what im doing and why.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>- Used confidently with pseudocode to double check you know what you are doing.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong>- Relies a fair bit on how well the error messages are setup. some languages are better than others.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Console logging</strong>- Good for aligning what you think should be happening with what is actually happening.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Googling</strong>- Best used when you have a grasp of what you want to get done.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>- Very helpful for situations where you want a fresh pair of eyes to check you didnt mix up something basic.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>- Useful for when you are close but arnt quite understanding something.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>- Very useful but often overlooked as I often have a habit of quickly throwing myself at the next problem.
