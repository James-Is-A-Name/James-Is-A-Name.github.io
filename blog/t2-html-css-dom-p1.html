    <h1>An Entry in the blog for reflection on HTML and CSS</h1>

    <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML,CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to a non-technical friend?</h2>
    <p>
        An analogy would be a script for a show or play.<br>
        HTML elements are the lines for the characters. e.g. person A:"a line of dialogue"<br>
        CSS provides stage directions. e.g. preson A speaks loudly while crossing the sceen.<br>
        DOM is how the show or play itself is actually going to go.
        If the script(HTML) says a person has one line but the actor decides to change it they are checning the DOM.

    <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
    <p>
        Seperating a design out into areas/boxes of distinct things. For a web page a few examples of boxes are heading, navigation and content.
        Within these boxes they can often be further seperated into smaller areas such as blog entires and then further still
        with boxes like text and images.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
    <p>
        When talking about a website from a visual design perspective the box model refers to how CSS shows and treats an element.
        each box has the box itself which is represented with the border attribute. for outside the box there is the attribute margin which
        tells the box how to deal with other boxes around it. Inside the box is the content which is the substance of the box
        which is then told how it fits within the box with the padding attribute which says how to stay away from the boarder of the box.
