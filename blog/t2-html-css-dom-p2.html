      <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
      <p>
        Grid based design is the design methodology of how websites are represented. Grid based design allows for easy placement and layout of design to align it in a way that follows on from the the boxes design of a mockup.

      <h2>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
      <p>
        A responsive webpage is all about being useable and nice looking independent of what device is used to view it. A responsive website is more inclusive and wont alienate users for their viewing device choices. A more accommodating website means more likely someone will use it again.

      <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic structure is labeling elements based on what they contain and what they are intended for, not what they should look like. An example of semantic structure is the title of a page having an h1 tag as it is the main heading from which the main content of the page is about. 
        A shopping list of items could use a ul tag as it they are a list of things to get with not much importance on order where as instruction for a recipe would want to use ol as the instructions order matters.

      <h2>Any other points you found intersting and want to reflect on?</h2>
      <p>
        The use of bootstraping designs looks useful for its speed but could cause bloat and make debugging/tweaking things a bit irritating.
