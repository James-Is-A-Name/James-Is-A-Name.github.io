      <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
      <p>
        Reading the chapter showed the intersting idea of focusing on the body to detect your emotional responses and habits.
        <br>Also that I am a man of few words.
      </p>

      <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>
        The result was similar to when you just let your mind wander on whatever topic it follows. Proabably similar concepts and hopefully im not missinterpeting how to do things.
